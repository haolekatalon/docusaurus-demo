## <a id="id_1" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Introduction

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Selenium WebDriver is a tool for automating web application   testing, and in particular to verify that they work as expected. It   aims to provide a friendly API that's easy to explore and   understand, easier to use than the Selenium-RC (1.0) API, which   will help to make your tests easier to read and maintain.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p"><a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://www.katalon.com/" target="_blank">Katalon Studio</a> uses the   Selenium engine for automated testing of Web applications. This   means that Katalon uses the Selenium WebDriver framework and hides   the complexities of dealing with WebDriver from users. You don't   have to care about WebDriver but instead work with Katalon keywords   only.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">However, you can still use WebDriver directly if you prefer. Or,   if you need more flexibilities than Katalon provides, you can   simply write scripts working with WebDriver directly. In this   article, I'll present a few best practices to benefit from   WebDriver, which may be of interest to experienced automation   testers who want to work with  Selenium directly.</p> 

## <a id="id_2" class="anchor_top_offset"/>How Katalon Studio uses Selenium WebDriver

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The most important thing to mention is that you do not have to   create a WebDriver instance. Katalon does it for you when you call   the <strong className="ph b">WebUI.<em className="ph i">openBrowser</em>   </strong> keyword.</p> 
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver{"\n"}import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver{"\n"}import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.keyword.WebUiBuiltInKeywords as WebUI{"\n"} {"\n"}WebUI.openBrowser(''){"\n"}WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(){"\n"}{"\n"}</code></pre> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In the code above, Chrome is used as an example, but you can   create any other driver type such as FirefoxDriver and   InternetExplorerDriver. You may also have to set a Java system   property with the driver location at the start of your test    (as the code below). To terminate the WebDriver instance, call   <em className="ph i">driver.close().</em> </p> 
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\test\\chromedriver.exe"){"\n"}</code></pre> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In both cases, you get a new browser instance and you can use it   in Katalon. The only difference is that (at this point) you cannot   use Katalon WebUI keywords with your manually created WebDriver   instance. For these purposes, there is a library called   <strong className="ph b">DriverFactory</strong>.</p> 

## <a id="id_3" class="anchor_top_offset"/>DriverFactory

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Katalon developers were aware that WebDriver methods may be   useful for users, so they introduced the DriverFactory library.   This library is responsible for manipulation with the WebDriver   instance and offers a few useful methods for using WebDriver in   Katalon.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">One of the biggest benefits which are brought by this library is   the <em className="ph i">changeWebDriver()</em> method. As I mentioned earlier, it   is not possible to use Katalon keywords with custom WebDriver   instances by default. But as soon as you call this method, you'll   be able to use them. Katalon will set your driver as a default one,   and the full Katalon's functionality is provided.</p> 
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver{"\n"}import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver{"\n"}import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.keyword.WebUiBuiltInKeywords as WebUI{"\n"}System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\test\\chromedriver.exe"){"\n"} {"\n"}WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(){"\n"} {"\n"}// this won't work and exception would be thrown{"\n"} {"\n"}WebUI.click(testObject){"\n"} {"\n"}DriverFactory.changeWebDriver(driver){"\n"} {"\n"}// now, it is working as expected{"\n"} {"\n"}WebUI.click(testObject){"\n"}{"\n"}</code></pre> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Another great method of the DriverFactory library is   <em className="ph i">getWebDriver()</em>. It is the opposite of the case above   – you can get an instance of WebDriver created by Katalon and   use WebDriver's methods afterward.</p> 
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver{"\n"}import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.driver.DriverFactory{"\n"}import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.keyword.WebUiBuiltInKeywords as WebUI{"\n"} {"\n"}WebUI.openBrowser(''){"\n"}WebDriver myDriver = DriverFactory.getWebDriver(){"\n"}{"\n"}</code></pre> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Using this method, you get a WebDriver instance created in the   <em className="ph i">openBrowser()</em> method. Another useful method is   DriverFactory.getChromeDriverPath<em className="ph i">(),</em> which returns the   path to Chrome/Firefox/any other driver (just replace browser name   in method) from the Katalon folder. You can use it instead of   hardcoding a path to WebDriver as above.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">There are also other methods and properties of the DriverFactory   class, for further information please visit <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://docs.katalon.com/javadoc/index.html" target="_blank">API     documentation page</a>.</p> 
    

## <a id="id_4" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Multiple WebDrivers

    
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Katalon Studio currently does not allow you to use multiple   drivers at once. When you call WebUI.<em className="ph i">openBrowser()</em> twice,   it terminates the first browser window and opens the second one. If   you need multiple drivers, you can create them by yourself and   switch between them.</p> 
              
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver{"\n"}import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver{"\n"} {"\n"}import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.driver.DriverFactory{"\n"} {"\n"}System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", DriverFactory.getChromeDriverPath()){"\n"}WebDriver driver1 = new ChromeDriver(){"\n"}WebDriver driver2 = new ChromeDriver(){"\n"} {"\n"}DriverFactory.changeWebDriver(driver1){"\n"}// first part of test{"\n"} {"\n"}DriverFactory.changeWebDriver(driver2){"\n"}// second part of test{"\n"} {"\n"}driver1.close(){"\n"}driver2.close(){"\n"}{"\n"}</code></pre> 
            
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Your tests may require multiple browser instances to, for   example, test the communication between two separate browsers, you   may need to create multiple drivers and switch between them   dynamically.</p> 
    
  
    

## <a id="id_5" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Sample usage and benefits of Selenium WebDriver

    
                  

### <a id="id_6" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Operations on multiple Web elements

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Selenium users are usually familiar with the WebDriver method   <em className="ph i">findElements()</em> which returns a list of WebElements found   by a specified selector. This method may be useful when you need to   do something with multiple elements, i.e. tally them or click on   all of them.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">See this code as an example of how to count the total of options   in a select box using WebDriver.</p> 
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>import org.openqa.selenium.By{"\n"}import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver{"\n"}import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver{"\n"} {"\n"}System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", DriverFactory.getChromeDriverPath()){"\n"}WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(){"\n"}List optionsList = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//select[@id='selectBox1']/option")){"\n"} {"\n"}int numberOfOptions = optionsList.size(){"\n"}{"\n"}</code></pre> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Or – use foreach loop to manipulate the WebElements list   (only the last row from previous code snippet is changed)</p> 
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>for(WebElement option in optionsList) {"{"}{"\n"}println option.getAttribute("value"){"\n"}{"}"}{"\n"}</code></pre> 
      

### <a id="id_7" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Easy transition from Java Selenium projects to Katalon's

      
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">If you already have Selenium projects written in Java, it is   easy to start using Katalon without losing your previous work. All   your Java code would work also in Katalon, you should only call the   <em className="ph i">changeWebDriver()</em> method to be able to use Katalon's   built-in keywords.</p> 
      
    
      

### <a id="id_8" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Options and capabilities

      
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You can simply set different options and/or capabilities to your   WebDriver (and set them only locally in a test case, only if you   need them). You then just pass them to a WebDriver constructor at   the time when you create it.</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">This is a sample code for setting a custom download path (and   download without prompt):</p> 
                  
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver{"\n"}import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver{"\n"}import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeOptions{"\n"}import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.driver.DriverFactory{"\n"} {"\n"}String downloadPath = "C:\\customDownloadFolder\\"{"\n"} {"\n"}Map&lt;String, Object&gt; chromePrefs = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;(){"\n"}chromePrefs.put("download.default_directory", downloadPath){"\n"}chromePrefs.put("download.prompt_for_download", false){"\n"} {"\n"}System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", DriverFactory.getChromeDriverPath()){"\n"}ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions(){"\n"}options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", chromePrefs){"\n"}WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options){"\n"}{"\n"}</code></pre> 
              
    

### <a id="id_9" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Actions

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html" target="_blank">Actions</a>   is a powerful API for emulating complex user gestures from   Selenium. If you want to use it, you need an instance of WebDriver   as this instance is required in a constructor of the Actions   class.</p> 
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver{"\n"}import org.openqa.selenium.interactions.Actions{"\n"}import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.driver.DriverFactory{"\n"} {"\n"}WebDriver driver = DriverFactory.getWebDriver(){"\n"}Actions myAction = new Actions(driver){"\n"}{"\n"}</code></pre> 
    

## <a id="id_10" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Conclusion

    
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In this article, I introduced basic ways how to work with   WebDriver instances in Katalon. From my point of view, the main   advantage of this approach is that you can benefit from both sides   – Katalon and WebDriver. If something is difficult to do in   Katalon – do it in WebDriver! And vice versa. Don't be afraid   of using WebDriver, sometimes you can have a much simpler solution   by using it.</p>
