<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The <strong className="ph b">Productivity</strong> dashboard allows you to   monitor the total number of test cases you have created in your   project within a specified period. It can group the total number of   completed tests into a daily/weekly/monthly report.</p> 
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="note note note_note"><span className="note__title">Note:</span> 
  <ul className="ul"><li className="li"><p className="p">The default period is the last 6 months (compared to the current
        date).</p></li></ul>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">As the name suggests, the <strong className="ph b">Productivity</strong>   dashboard emphasizes the productivity level based on the number of   test cases created over a period of time.</p> 
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The more tests are created and run, the more impact it has on   the performance. For example, with the default 6-month period, the   dashboard helps you compare the number of test cases between the   current month and other months. Whether there are more or fewer   test cases created within this period, you can check if your team   has increased or decreased testing activities every month. This   report, combined with other analytics (on quality, platform   coverage, requirement coverage and so on), could provide a complete   account of your team's performance.</p>
