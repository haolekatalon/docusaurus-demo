<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   <img className="image" src={useBaseUrl("https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/overview/kt-dashboard-platform-coverage-ui-may2022.png")} alt="platform coverage dashboard" /><br /><br /> </p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The <strong className="ph b">Platform Coverage</strong> dashboard shows the   coverage of test runs or test results in each corresponding   operating system and browser. You can filter the profile and   specify a period to check the test coverage in your project.</p> 
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="note note note_note"><span className="note__title">Note:</span> 
  <ul className="ul"><li className="li"><p className="p">The default period is the last 6 months (compared to the current
        date).</p></li></ul>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Testing your software/application on different platforms is   vital to see if it works accordingly. Hence this dashboard offers   you a comprehensive report of all platform performance.</p> 
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The dashboard offers you the following insights:</p> 
      
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">You can understand how many test runs have been executed on     each platform based on the size of each dot. Consequently, you know     which platform has more or less test executions than the other     platforms.</li>   <li className="li">You can figure out the percentage of failed/passed test runs on     each platform based on the color of each dot. Consequently, you     know which platform has more or less failed/passed tests than the     other platforms.</li> </ul> 
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You then know if your project is going in the right direction   through such analytics. Your team could also learn to focus on the   prioritized platforms in accordance with the initial plan.</p> 
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">For example, within the default 6-month period and if you select   the <strong className="ph b">By Test Run</strong> option, and the report is   represented as follows:</p> 
      
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">One green dot in the "Mac OS &amp; Chrome" platform.</li>   <li className="li">One orange dot in the "Linux &amp; Firefox" platform.</li>   <li className="li">The size of the green dot is more significant than the orange     one.</li> </ul> 
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Then the analytics provides you with the following   information:</p> 
      
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">     <p className="p">Tests are run better (e.g., more <em className="ph i">passed</em> tests and with       a consistent result) on Mac OS &amp; Chrome than on Linux &amp;       Firefox.</p>   </li>   <li className="li">     <p className="p">The quality of test runs on Mac OS &amp; Chrome is better than       Linux &amp; Firefox.</p>   </li>   <li className="li">     <p className="p">There are more tests on Mac OS &amp; Chrome and they are of a       good quality (because the dot is green and bigger in size) while       the quality is not so good on Linux &amp; Firefox (because it's       orange) and the team should focus on creating more tests and fixing       bugs for tests on Linux &amp; Firefox platform.</p>   </li> </ul>
