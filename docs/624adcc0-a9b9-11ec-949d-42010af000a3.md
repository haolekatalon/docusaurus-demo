<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Publishing plugins allows them to be used by others, who can   access and install them from Katalon Store.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You can publish your plugin publicly so that any Katalon user   can find and install it. In addition to published plugins, you can   also save your plugin as a draftâ€”this lets you test it or   just use it yourself without publishing.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Once you've successfully published a plugin, you can continue to   update and manage it in <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://store.katalon.com/manage/publisher" target="_blank">Published     plugins</a> page.</p>
