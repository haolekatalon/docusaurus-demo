<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   <img className="image" src={useBaseUrl("https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/overview/kt-dashboard-test-activities-ui-may2022.png")} alt="test activities dashboard" /><br /><br /> </p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Testing activities help you evaluate and verify if your product   is doing what it’s supposed to do. If your product works the   way it should, testing prevents bugs and reduces development costs   while improving the performance of your software/application.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">A centralized report on your test activities enables faster   troubleshooting and assists you in the decision-making process of   your product cycle.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In Katalon TestOps, the <strong className="ph b">Test Activities</strong>   dashboard compiles test activities over a specified period. You can   filter test runs by day, week, and month and check test results   within your desired period.</p> 
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="note note note_note"><span className="note__title">Note:</span> 
  <ul className="ul"><li className="li"><p className="p">The default period is 7 days (from Monday to Sunday of the most
        recent week, compared to the current date).</p></li></ul>

### <a id="id_3" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Total Test Runs

      
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   <img className="image" src={useBaseUrl("https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/overview/kt-dashboard-test-activities-total-test-run-ui-may2022.png")} alt="total test run chart" /><br /><br /> </p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The <strong className="ph b">Total Test Runs</strong> chart provides a   daily/weekly/monthly testing statistic by highlighting the number   of tests with passed and failed status plus the total testing   duration.</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The chart allows you to answer the following questions:</p> 
        
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">     <p className="p">Are tests frequently run every day/week/month?</p>   </li>   <li className="li">     <p className="p">What is the status of all test runs each day/week/month (whether       more tests have passed or failed)?</p>   </li>   <li className="li">     <p className="p">How long does it take to run tests each day (by checking the       total duration of test runs per day)?</p>   </li> </ul> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You can also compare the total duration of test runs between   each day to see which day tests run slow and which day tests run   fast.</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">For instance, yesterday, the actual time to execute 5 tests was   2 minutes; however, today, it takes 5 minutes to complete 3 test   runs. Knowing this prompts you to investigate further to ensure   better testing quality and testing timeline.</p> 
      
    
      

### <a id="id_4" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Execution Result

      
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   <img className="image" src={useBaseUrl("https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/overview/kt-dashboard-test-activities-execution-result-ui-may2022.png")} alt="execution result chart" /><br /><br /> </p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You also see a complete overview of test results in the   <strong className="ph b">Execution Result</strong> chart, where test cases and   results are highlighted with the following 4 options: passed,   failed, error, or incomplete, together with their execution   time.</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">This chart allows you to answer the following questions:</p> 
        
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">     <p className="p">What is the quality of the test cases and results within the       specified period?</p>     <p className="p">Since it’s less worrying if there are fewer failed or       error tests, or else you need to take further actions (revise test       cases and their results) to ensure your application/software is       working as expected.</p>   </li>   <li className="li">     <p className="p">What is the difference in the quality of tests between last week       and this week? Has the number of failed/passed test results       decreased or increased within 2 consecutive weeks?</p>   </li>   <li className="li">     <p className="p">What are the number of test cases and test results this week       compared to last week? Is there an increase or decrease in the       number of test executions?</p>   </li> </ul> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Through analyzing the chart, you can evaluate your test   activities and take further actions if needed.</p>
