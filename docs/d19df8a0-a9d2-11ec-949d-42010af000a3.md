## <a id="id_1" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Change to licensing model

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The licensing model for Katalon Studio Enterprise (KSE) and Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE) is changing. KSE node-locked and floating license types as well as KRE node-locked license types are being deprecated. The licensing model for both products is transitioning to the following:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">KSE node-locked and floating license → KSE per-User license</li><li className="li">KRE node-locked and floating license → KRE floating license</li></ul>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="sectiondiv"><strong className="ph b">Node-Locked License</strong><p className="p">This license type is applied to local desktops or workstations with fixed hardware specifications (machine-blocked license), such as:</p><ul className="ul"><li className="li">A virtual machine with a fixed machine ID</li><li className="li">A physical machine</li></ul><p className="p">With node-locked licenses, one machine running tests = one license.</p><ul className="ul"><li className="li">A license is tied to a single machine ID and only for one execution session at a time.</li><li className="li">A machine can be mapped to multiple licenses if needed.</li><li className="li">For machines connected to the internet, the licenses can be transferred to other machines at no cost and as many times as needed.</li><li className="li">For <em className="ph i">annual licenses</em> only: Licenses can be converted to be used in an offline environment. Once converted, the license cannot be transferred to another machine until it is expired.</li><li className="li">Licenses purchased on a monthly basis cannot be converted for use in an offline environment.</li></ul></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="sectiondiv"><strong className="ph b">Floating License</strong><p className="p">For scaling teams with dynamic usage, floating licenses reduce the management cost and optimize your workflow.</p><p className="p">This license type is applied to all types of execution environments, including cloud or virtual machines with dynamic hardware specifications (to execute tests in Docker, Azure, AWS).</p><ul className="ul"><li className="li">One floating license can be shared across a maximum of 3 machines.</li><li className="li">One floating license is assigned to one execution session at a time.</li></ul><p className="p">For instance, you have 1 floating Katalon Studio Enterprise license attached to the email <a className="xref j-external-link" href="mailto:example@katalon.com">example@katalon.com</a>.</p><p className="p">You can use <a className="xref j-external-link" href="mailto:example@katalon.com">example@katalon.com</a> to log in to Katalon Studio on up to 3 different machines, but not at the same time. This is because <a className="xref j-external-link" href="mailto:example@katalon.com">example@katalon.com</a> represents only 1 floating Katalon Studio Enterprise license. Therefore, you can only be active on 1 of those 3 machines at a time.</p></div>

## <a id="id_2" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Transition plan for monthly subscriptions

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="note note note_note"><span className="note__title">Note:</span> 
  <p className="p" /><div className="p"><ul className="ul"><li className="li">This section is only applicable to users who have purchased licenses on a monthly, auto-renewed subscription plan, before March 7th, 2022.</li></ul></div>
</div>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Changes will only affect your subscription during the renewal of your license plan, and will have different outcomes depending on the date of renewal. A grace period of 3 months is set during which changes to license prices will not affect the price of your licenses, regardless of your license types. The grace period ends on June 7th, 2022.</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li"><p className="p">Before June 7th, 2022, you will retain the same license types at the same cost.</p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">After June 7th, 2022, renewed monthly subscriptions will automatically transition to the new license types, as mapped above, and at the listed price.</p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">Additional costs will only affect plans that are renewed after the end of the grace period.</p>     <p className="p">For example: Suppose you have purchased a node-locked license for KRE that renews on the 14th of each month. From March to April 14th, this will remain a node-locked license. You decide to buy an extra node-locked license at the same price as the previous one. On June 14th, both licenses become floating licenses at the listed price. On June 14th, your billing now reflects the cost of two floating licenses.</p></li></ul>

## <a id="id_3" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Technical support for annual or multi-year contract

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">If you currently have an annual or multi-year contract, deprecating license types will continue to function as expected until the end of your current contract. Once that contract ends, only new license types will be available for use.</p> 
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="note note note_note"><span className="note__title">Note:</span> 
  <ul className="ul"><li className="li">For KSE, floating and node-locked licenses cannot co-exist with
      per-User licenses. You cannot directly purchase per-User licenses
      until your contract expires or you decide to transition to the new
      license model. You can contact the Success team at
      success@katalon.com, if you want to immediately convert to the
      per-User licensing model.</li></ul></div>

## <a id="concept-7157" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Migration mapping of KSE floating to KSE per-User licenses

      

### <a id="id_5" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Case 1: Automatic transition to KSE per-User licenses

      
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">This case applies to those of you whose license renewal date is   due, and happens automatically.</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Consider a scenario where you are a group of 5 users. You have   the following licenses at your disposal:</p> 
        
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">1 generated Offline floating license.</li>   <li className="li">3 floating licenses.</li> </ul> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">As you can see above, the number of people in your group (5   users) is more than the number of licenses itself (3 floating   licenses). Thus, when the license renewal date approaches, 3 KSE   per-User licenses are issued to your group, based on the following   order of priority:</p> 
        
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">1 user who has an Offline floating license.</li>   <li className="li">2 unique users who are last seen active.</li> </ul> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Thus, you can say:</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   <em className="ph i">N Offline licenses + O unique last active users = P     licenses</em> </p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In general, if you have 1,3,4,5……n KSE floating   licenses, an equivalent number of last active users receive   corresponding per-User licenses.</p> 
      
    
      

### <a id="id_6" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Case 2: Manual transition to KSE per-User licenses

      
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">This case applies to those of you whose license renewal date is   not due, but wish to renew your license manually.</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Consider a scenario where you are a group of 5 users and wish to   transition to per-User licenses. To do this, you log into the <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://katalon.com/pricing/?utm_medium=search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=IN_KS_Katalon_Brand_Phrase&utm_content=540916077295_c_&utm_term=katalon%20studio%20license&gclid=Cj0KCQiAybaRBhDtARIsAIEG3kneVeZ28Q-BV9oJ-SEyGMd0XRtS0ipCVaUSuxAspAR4U9k7iwQJDhEaApTxEALw_wcB" target="_blank">Katalon</a>   website and confirm that you wish to merge your floating licenses   to new per-User licenses.</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Once you confirm your interest for the transition to per-User   licenses, the licenses are assigned to you on order of priority, as   it was during automatic renewal.</p>
