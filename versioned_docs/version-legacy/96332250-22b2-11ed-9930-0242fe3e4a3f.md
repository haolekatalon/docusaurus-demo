<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">After execution, there are two places for you to view BDD reports: in Katalon Studio and in Katalon TestOps.</p> 

## <a id="id_11" class="anchor_top_offset"/>View BDD reports in Katalon Studio

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">There is no custom report for executing Feature File. Katalon Studio uses only generated Cucumber reports for test suite and test suite collection execution level, in which the test cases contain the Cucumber Features file.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The generated Cucumber reports of test suite and test suite collection are located in the same folder of Katalon Studio report folder. In Katalon Studio Tests Explorer, right-click at the desired <span className="ph uicontrol">Report</span> folder and choose <span className="ph uicontrol">Open Containing Folder</span>. Katalon Studio redirects you to the local folder where Cucumber Reports are stored. </p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Katalon Studio supports three formats for Cucumber reports: JSON, XML, HTML.</p>

## <a id="id_10" class="anchor_top_offset"/>View BDD reports in Katalon TestOps

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Katalon TestOps has dedicated support for viewing BDD test   results as well as advanced analytics and reports such as   Traceability Matrix Report. To learn about Traceability Matrix   Report, you can refer to this document: <a className="xref" href="/docs/legacy/katalon-testops/reporting/view-traceability-matrix">Traceability     Matrix Report</a>.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">By default, the BDD test report feature on Katalon TestOps is   disabled to avoid mixing the BDD and Katalon Studio formatted data.   To enable the feature, you can refer to this guide: <a className="xref" href="/docs/legacy/katalon-testops/test-management/view-bdd-test-results">View     BDD Test Results in Katalon TestOps</a>.</p>
